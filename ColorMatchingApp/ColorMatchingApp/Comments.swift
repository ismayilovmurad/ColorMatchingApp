// MARK: Actions Popup on the Preview and on the Code - Command-Click or Control-Command-Click

// MARK: In IB, you could drag several objects onto the view, then select them all and embed them in a stack view. But the SwiftUI Embed command only works on a single object.

// MARK: Attributes Inspector Popup on the code - Control-Option-Click

// MARK: Some modifiers can be applied to all view types, while others can be applied only to specific view types, like Text or shapes. Not all Text modifiers return a Text view.
